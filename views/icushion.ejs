                                iCushion is a smart cushion that helps children improve their sitting posture. It can be viewed as an intelligent system that samples and analyses multi-channel data, provides health advice, and thereby helps children develop healthy sitting habits.

                While children aged 0-14 years make up 17% of the population in China, there is a large gap in medical services for children. Moreover, children's demand for safety is higher than adults. In this context, they need targeted products to prevent pressure-related diseases.

                    The increase in children’s workload makes them stay seated for longer. Their sitting postures are generally incorrect, but the utilization rate of orthopedic product is low. <br/>

                    Cervical spondylosis of children is not caused by cervical degeneration, but is due to cramping fatigue and accumulation of chronic bad habits. <br/>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Through the quantitative analysis of sitting postures and pressure figures, we came to three conclusions:<br/>
                1. When children are in reading, writing or painting, the pressure data is not very different. This shows that learning scenarios do not need to be further divided. <br/>
                2. Compared with sitting position, the relative position of children has a greater impact than sitting postures on pressure data. The shape of the cushion should be able to fix the relative position of children sitting on it.<br/>
                3. It is difficult to determine the degree of curvature of the back of a child only through the pressure data sampling of the cushion plane, so the sample points should also be set on the backrest.</p>

                We placed six membrane pressure sensors in the cushion as sampling points, and their readings corresponded to six sectors in the app. We also collected the pressure distribution when children sat on it in normal sitting position and set it as the initial value. <br/>
                When using iCushion, the greater the deviation from the initial values for the six sample points, the lower the score in the app.
